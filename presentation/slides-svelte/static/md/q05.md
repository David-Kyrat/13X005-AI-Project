## Role of sensors


<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- Image sensors play a crucial role in the process of image acquisition. 
- They are responsible for converting the incoming light (photons) into electrical signals (electrons). 

- This process involves the sampling of the scene projected onto the focal plane and converting the light into an electric current, followed by analog-to-digital conversion (with quantization) to obtain a digital image.

## Photon counting

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- Measurement of the number of photons hitting the sensor, get converted into electrons. 
- Not all photons get converted into electrons, it depends on photon energy, more photon is collected the better. 
- This process is crucial for determining the image's brightness and color.
- The count of photons is subject to the Poisson distribution, indicating the randomness in the number of photons arriving per pixel, even in a uniformly lit scene.
- Larger sensor sizes can collect more photons, leading to higher sensitivity. 
- However, larger pixels or adding pixels can lead to a loss of resolution. 
- On the other hand, smaller pixels can theoretically collect the same amount of electrons as larger pixels, but aperture and focusing differences must be considered.
- photon shot noise if pixels too small => noise.

## Photon counting - Trad-offs

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

photon shot noise if pixels too small => noise.

It's a trade-off between pixel size and the total number of pixels.  
Larger pixels (having greater area) can accumulate more photons, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR for a Poisson process (photon counting) is given by $SNR = 20\log_{10}(\sqrt{\alpha})$
where $\alpha$ is the average number of photons. Larger pixels improve SNR but reduce spatial resolution, whereas smaller pixels increase resolution but have lower SNR. 

- Advantages of larger sensor sizes:
  - Higher sensitivity due to the ability to collect more photons.
  - Potential for better image quality in low-light conditions.
- Disadvantages of larger sensor sizes:
  - Reduced resolution. => larger pixels => less pixels.
- Advantages of smaller sensor sizes:
  - Potential for higher resolution due to smaller pixel sizes.
  - Compact and lightweight, suitable for smaller devices.
- Disadvantages of smaller sensor sizes:
  - Lower sensitivity in low-light conditions due to the limited photon collection capability.
