## Explain the CMYK model. Exemplify the reflection of colors. <br> Explain the principles of halftoning. Why is K used in CMYK model in practice, while it is enough to have CMY to simulate any color?

## What and how RGB ?

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between ">

**What are red, green blue colors and how do we perceive them?**

- The human eye is sensitive to light in the range 400-700 nm, which corresponds to the visible spectrum.
  The color of light is determined by its wavelength.

- The retina contains three types of cones, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths.

- Short-wavelength (S) cones are sensitive to blue light (400-500 nm).

- Medium-wavelength (M) cones are sensitive to green light (500-600 nm).

- Long-wavelength (L) cones are sensitive to red light (600-700 nm).

- Due to this a standardization was applied (CIE) defined RGB to be the 3 "primary" colors with:
$$
	\lambda_B = 435.8 nm,\quad \lambda_G = 546.1nm,\quad \lambda_R = 700nm
$$

## Addivtive vs Subtractive Color Mixing


<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- The RGB format mentionned earlier is known as so-called "*additive*" color mixing
- At the "beginning" we have rgb(0, 0, 0) i.e. "nothing" i.e. black, and we add shades of red, green and blue (with varying hues)  to be mixed into our desired color.
- It is called "additive" because we *"add colors"* to *"no colors"* to get our desired color.
- It is the color system used by default on screens (TV, computer monitors, this projector, etc.)

- The subtractive color system does the exact opposite, it starts with white and subtracts colors to get the desired color.
- White is said to be the conjunction of all colors, and black is the absence of color.  
Hence, the name of the system that starts from white, "subtractive" and the one that starts from black, "additive", make sense.

- We *"remove colors"* to *"all colors"*.

- It is the color system used by default on printers (inkjet, laser, etc.), (NB: paper is white.)

## CMY and CMYK

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- The subtractive color system works with CMYK color system, where C stands for cyan, M for magenta, Y for yellow and K for black.

- As explained on the slide before it works by subtracting colors using color reflection (see image on the right)

- $C = 1 − R = R + G + B − R = G + B$

- Black is obtained as mix of C, M, Y and K but it is much more conveniant to use add an "external" source of black.
    - Using 1 ink instead of 3 is much cheaper
    - No mixing error (dosage would need to be $33.\bar{3}$ each perfectly)
    - superior quality
    - Less ink => paper less wet
