## What and how RGB ?

**What are red, green blue colors and how do we perceive them?**

- The human eye is sensitive to light in the range 400-700 nm, which corresponds to the visible spectrum.
  The color of light is determined by its wavelength.

- The retina contains three types of cones, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths.

- Short-wavelength (S) cones are sensitive to blue light (400-500 nm).

- Medium-wavelength (M) cones are sensitive to green light (500-600 nm).

- Long-wavelength (L) cones are sensitive to red light (600-700 nm).

- Due to this a standardization was applied (CIE) defined RGB to be the 3 "primary" colors with:
$$
	\lambda_B = 435.8 nm,\quad \lambda_G = 546.1nm,\quad \lambda_R = 700nm
$$

## Addivtive vs Subtractive Color Mixing


<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- The RGB format mentionned earlier is known as so-called "*additive*" color mixing
- At the "beginning" we have rgb(0, 0, 0) i.e. "nothing" i.e. black, and we add shades of red, green and blue (with varying hues)  to be mixed into our desired color.
- It is called "additive" because we *"add colors"* to *"no colors"* to get our desired color.
- It is the color system used by default on screens (TV, computer monitors, this projector, etc.)

- The subtractive color system does the exact opposite, it starts with white and subtracts colors to get the desired color.
- White is said to be the conjunction of all colors, and black is the absence of color.  
Hence, the name of the system that starts from white, "subtractive" and the one that starts from black, "additive", make sense.

- We *"remove colors"* to *"all colors"*.

- It is the color system used by default on printers (inkjet, laser, etc.), (NB: paper is white.)

## The Chromaticity Color Diagram

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- Fundamental concept in color theory. It's a 2D representation of colors based on the CIE 1931 XYZ color space.
- X and Y axes represent the color's chromaticity, which defines its hue and saturation. 

- The spectral colors, or pure hues, are located on the outer boundary of this diagram. 
- Colors inside this boundary are mixtures, resulting in the full gamut of colors perceivable by the human eye.
- White light in this diagram, depicted as the sum of equal parts of the primary colors. 

- Only triangle can be reproduced (no point g.), when using prime colors. Color **gamut**.

## The Chromaticity Color Diagram, factors

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- Only triangle can be reproduced (no point g.), when using prime colors. Color **gamut**.

- This gamut varies based on the primary colors used by the device, with screens using RGB and printers using CMYK models. The gamut is affected by factors like primary color wavelengths, display technology, and ink quality .
- Device-Dependent Range: Gamut varies with different devices.
- Color Encoding Systems: NTSC-YIQ, YUV, YCbCr...
- Display and Printing Technologies: LCD, OLED, TFT, Plasma
