## Image Formation in the Eye

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack grow text-left">

- Vision is a complex process that involves the conversion of light into electrical signals via photoreceptors to be then interpreted by the brain.

- The human eye operates similarly to a camera, where the pupil acts as an aperture, and the lens focuses light onto the retina.
  Iris controls the aperture size (pupil size) to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.

- The retina contains two types of photoreceptors: **rods** (a lot) for _low-light_, _can't distinguish colors_ well,
  and **cones** (fewer, in the fovea), for _bright light_ and _color vision_.

- The cones are densely packed in the fovea, a region crucial for sharp central vision. Focal length in the eye is in the range of 14-17 mm, and focusing involves changing the curvature of the lens rather than altering the distance between the lens and the retina, which remains fixed.

## What and how RGB ?

**What are red, green blue colors and how do we perceive them?**

- The human eye is sensitive to light in the range 400-700 nm, which corresponds to the visible spectrum.
  The color of light is determined by its wavelength.

- The retina contains three types of cones, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths.

- Short-wavelength (S) cones are sensitive to blue light (400-500 nm).

- Medium-wavelength (M) cones are sensitive to green light (500-600 nm).

- Long-wavelength (L) cones are sensitive to red light (600-700 nm).

- Due to this a standardization was applied (CIE) defined RGB to be the 3 "primary" colors with:
$$
	\lambda_B = 435.8 nm,\quad \lambda_G = 546.1nm,\quad \lambda_R = 700nm
$$

## Addivtive vs Subtractive Color Mixing


<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- The RGB format mentionned earlier is known as so-called "*additive*" color mixing
- At the "beginning" we have rgb(0, 0, 0) i.e. "nothing" i.e. black, and we add shades of red, green and blue (with varying hues)  to be mixed into our desired color.
- It is called "additive" because we *"add colors"* to *"no colors"* to get our desired color.
- It is the color system used by default on screens (TV, computer monitors, this projector, etc.)

- The subtractive color system does the exact opposite, it starts with white and subtracts colors to get the desired color.
- White is said to be the conjunction of all colors, and black is the absence of color.  
Hence, the name of the system that starts from white, "subtractive" and the one that starts from black, "additive", make sense.

- We *"remove colors"* to *"all colors"*.

- It is the color system used by default on printers (inkjet, laser, etc.), (NB: paper is white.)
