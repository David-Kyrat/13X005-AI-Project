## Role of sensors


<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- Image sensors play a crucial role in the process of image acquisition. 
- They are responsible for converting the incoming light (photons) into electrical signals (electrons). 

- This process involves the sampling of the scene projected onto the focal plane and converting the light into an electric current, followed by analog-to-digital conversion (with quantization) to obtain a digital image.

## Image sensors

- Measurement of the number of photons hitting the sensor, get converted into electrons. 
- Not all photons get converted into electrons, it depends on photon energy,
more photon is collected the better $E_{photon} = h\frac{c}{\lambda} = hf$ where $h$ is Planck's constant. 
- The count of photons is subject to the Poisson distribution, indicating the randomness in the number of photons arriving per pixel, even in a uniformly lit scene.
- Larger sensor sizes can collect more photons, leading to higher sensitivity. 
- However, larger pixels or adding pixels can lead to a loss of resolution. 
- On the other hand, smaller pixels can theoretically collect the same amount of electrons as larger pixels, but aperture and focusing differences must be considered.
- photon shot noise if pixels too small => noise.
