## Image Formation in the Eye

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack grow text-left">

- Vision is a complex process that involves the conversion of light into electrical signals via photoreceptors to be then interpreted by the brain.

- The human eye operates similarly to a camera, where the pupil acts as an aperture, and the lens focuses light onto the retina.
  Iris controls the aperture size (pupil size) to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.

- The retina contains two types of photoreceptors: **rods** (a lot) for _low-light_, _can't distinguish colors_ well,
  and **cones** (fewer, in the fovea), for _bright light_ and _color vision_.

- The cones are densely packed in the fovea, a region crucial for sharp central vision. Focal length in the eye is in the range of 14-17 mm, and focusing involves changing the curvature of the lens rather than altering the distance between the lens and the retina, which remains fixed.

## What and how RGB ?

**What are red, green blue colors and how do we perceive them?**

- The human eye is sensitive to light in the range 400-700 nm, which corresponds to the visible spectrum.
  The color of light is determined by its wavelength.

- The retina contains three types of cones, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths.

- Short-wavelength (S) cones are sensitive to blue light (400-500 nm).

- Medium-wavelength (M) cones are sensitive to green light (500-600 nm).

- Long-wavelength (L) cones are sensitive to red light (600-700 nm).

- Due to this a standardization was applied (CIE) defined RGB to be the 3 "primary" colors with:
$$
	\lambda_B = 435.8 nm,\quad \lambda_G = 546.1nm,\quad \lambda_R = 700nm
$$

## Human Eyes vs. Cameras

**Focusing & Else**

<div class="r-hstack flex justify-between">
<div class="r-vstack text-left">

- Cameras adjust focus by moving the lens to change the distance between the lens and the image sensor (focal distance).

- i.e. Cameras have a fixed depth of field, meaning they can only focus on a specific range of distances at a time, while human eyes have a dynamic depth of field, allowing them to focus on objects at varying distances simultaneously, with accommodation.

- Accomodation: Human eye changes the shape of the lens to focus light and dynamically adapt.

- The dynamic range of the human eye is significantly larger than that of cameras, 
allowing it to adapt to a broad range of light intensities. 

- This adaptation is facilitated by the pupil's size variation and the retina's photoreceptor distribution.

- Low-light conditions due to the presence of rods human eyes have significantly greater advantage,
whereas cameras may require additional light sources 
or adjustments / long-exposure for optimal focus and detail rendering in low-light environments.
